# How to run 
### Open with Android Studio, run build.

### Once open, just run the project and it should open in the simulator assuming SDK is already selected.
## If no selected SDK, please choose Pixel 2 API 28 as that is the one that I used,

# Features
### Features I implemented include back and forward button, green button that will load a page, new tabs button, saving as bookmark and saved bookmarks page. 
### I also added a Share button at the top right where once pressed, will be able to share whatever content you want . :-)

# Approach
### I just tried to keep a simple approach and kept the UI minimalistic yet efficient.
### I know it mentions Kotlin but I have never used it before, so I have coded the entire thing in Java.
